## Using JavaScript, D3, and Leaflet to Create Maps

### Purpose
---
#### This assignment and challenge was apart of the UNC Chapel Hill Data Analytics course. The purpose of this code is to create maps based on Earthquake data from the past 7 days. The code goes through how to do basics in Leaflet: creating map layers and backgrounds; and adding markers like points, circles, lines, and polygons. Along with Leaflet, the D3 Javascript library is used to make multiple API calls to different websites to retrieve data along with styling the maps with different functions. 
#### The challenge assignment was to create a map using tectonic plates and earthquake data on three different map backgrounds.
